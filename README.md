# Admin panel/dashboard

This is web admin dashboard for my mobile app "AutoCareHub" made with flutter web. This project uses the GetX package for flutter for a complete solution in navigation, http requests and state management, and it is responsive! The App was made with Flutter and Dart libraries. It also includes authentication with firebase. There are multiple screens in this admin dashboard for a wider and broad overview of complete actions associated with our mobile app, that includes orders screen, products screen, customers details screen, and many more. Backend used is firebase's firestore with all crud operations for adminsitrative actions.
